## Highly Abstracted Cloud Platform

Estate is where developers create stateful, serverless backends by writing TypeScript domain-logic-only POJOs.

## Covers All the Cloud Minutea

No more _REST_ or _GraphQL_, no more interpreting HTTP status code arcanery, or API routing nonsense.

With no servers to manage nor ‘stacks’ to provision, Estate backends are live with a single command.

Estate lets you build a full-stack data model, without :
For CRUD backends, saving and using business data is painless as all the extra persistence code (DTOs, ORMs, etc) is not necessary

Consuming a Estate backend is beyond simple - all the client-connection code is generated for you.

Estate is entirely **open source** so there's no worry of vendor lock-in.

## Fast Track ⏱️
