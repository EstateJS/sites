# Hosting Options

## Sandbox (for development)

Estate provides a free-to-use sandbox cluster for development purposes.

:::caution ephemeral
The sandbox cluster is not for production use. If you would like to use Estate in production, you must host your own Estate platform or use our business-class managed hosting.
:::

## Commercial (Coming Soon!)

Estate will offer business-class managed hosting soon.

## On-premises

The Estate platform can be self-hosted using the scripts in the [system/build](https://github.com/EstateJS/system) repository. A production-grade deployment consists of a Kubernetes cluster with 6 workloads.
