# Introduction

![Alt](/img/banner.png "EstateJS Logo")

Get ready to experience life without DevOps or boilerplate.

Estate is a highly abstracted serverless cloud platform where developers create stateful backends by writing TypeScript domain-driven POJOs they already know how to write.

Estate handles all the cloud minutea: No more _REST_. No more interpreting HTTP status code arcanery, ORM layers, or web service routing nonsense. With no servers to manage nor ‘stacks’ to provision, Estate backends are live with a single command.

For CRUD backends, persisting and using business data is painless as all the extra persistence code (DTOs, ORMs, etc) is just not necessary: Estate lets you build a full-stack data model.

Consuming a Estate backend is trivial because all the client-connection code is generated for you.

Estate is entirely **open source** so there's no worry of vendor lock-in.
