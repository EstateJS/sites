## Developer Tools

To write code that runs on the platform you must install the development tools npm package.

### Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v16 and above (which can be checked with `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine.

### Install Developer Tools

Installing the development tools globally is recommended but not required.

```bash
npm install -g estate-tools
```

Alternatively you can install them as a dev dependency.

```bash
npm install --saveDev estate-tools
```
