# Introduction

![EstateJS Logo](/img/banner.png "EstateJS Logo")

## Highly Abstracted, Dev-first Platform

Estate is where developers create stateful, object-based serverless backends by writing TypeScript POJOs to form a full-stack data model.

## Covers All the Cloud Minutea

No more _REST_ or _GraphQL_, no more interpreting HTTP status code arcanery, or API routing nonsense.

With no servers to manage nor ‘stacks’ to provision, Estate backends are live with a single command.

## Painless CRUD Backends

Saving and using business data is painless as all the extra persistence code (DTOs, ORMs, etc) is not necessary.

Consuming a Estate backend is beyond simple - all the client-connection code is generated for you.

Estate is entirely **open source** so there's no worry of vendor lock-in.
