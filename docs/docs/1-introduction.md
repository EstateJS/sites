# Introduction

Get ready to experience life without DevOps or boilerplate.

Estate is a minimalistic, highly abstracted serverless cloud platform where developers create stateful backends by writing TypeScript domain-driven POJOs: just business logic and domain model. The platform handles all the cloud minutea.

No more _REST_. No more interpreting HTTP status code arcanery or web service routing nonsense. Consuming a Estate backend is trivial because all the client-connection code is generated for you.

With no servers to manage nor ‘stacks’ to provision, Estate backends are live with a single command.

Estate is entirely **open source** so there's no worry of vendor lock-in.
